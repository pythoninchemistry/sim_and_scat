## Code (in)efficiency

Please be aware that the Python code written in this tutorial has been written to prioritise understanding, above computational efficiency. Individual examples may therefore not be be the most efficient implementation of particular algorithms. That said, we have endeavoured to provide code examples that are “authentic”, and accurately represent the relevant aspects of “real” molecular dynamics methods.
