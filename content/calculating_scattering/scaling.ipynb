    "## Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "The downfall of the Debye method is that it scales $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number of particles, meaning that as the number of particles in the calculation increases, the time taken for the calculation **increases with a power law**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inefficiency of the Debye equation has lead to a series of approximations that lead to **improved efficiency**, while keeping a high level of accuracy. \n",
    "Examples of these include the Fibonacci sequence method from Svergun, and the Golden Vectors method of Watson and Curtis [1-3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Try increasing the number of particles in the simulation (you should probably also increase the simulation cell size), and observe the change in the efficiency of the simulation. "
