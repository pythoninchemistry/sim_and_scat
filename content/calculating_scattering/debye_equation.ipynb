    "## The Debye equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Debye equation is an **analytical** formulation to determine the scattering that arises from some system. \n",
    "In many ways, the Debye equation can be thought of as a weighted, analytical Fourier transform of the radial distribution function. \n",
    "It is weighted by the scattering length of the particular particles being considered, $b_i$ and $b_j$.\n",
    "This equation considers the distances between particles, $r_{ij}$, to determine the scattered intensity at a given $q$-vector, $I(q)$, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ I(q) = \\sum_i\\sum_jb_ib_j\\frac{\\sin{(qr_{ij})}}{qr_{ij}}. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "While this equation is analytically-precise, there are some **problems** with this method. \n",
    "In particular, that it requires a **pair-wise summation**, which is very slow for large systems such as those obtained in molecular dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python code below is a simple implimentation of the Debye function, where the scattering length is taken as 1.909 fm (the $b$ for argon) for all particles.\n",
    "Try different values for the scattering length, and observe how the resulting profile changes. "
