# Calculating Scattering

One of the main reasons that users of scattering techniques are interested in molecular dynamics simulation is to **compare** between the experiment and the simulation. 
However, in order to compare between the simulation and the experiment we need a way to calculate the scattering profile from the simulation trajectory.
There are many ways to derive such a profile, however we will focus on the **Debye equation**.
