# Run locally

To run the interactive components of the resource locally rather than on the web, it is necessary to have Jupyter Notebooks installed.
The easiest way to get Jupyter Notebooks is to install the [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) package.
Once the Jupyter Notebooks in available on your computer it is necessary to clone the following GitHub repository; [github.com/pythoninchemistry/sim_and_scat](https://github.com/pythoninchemistry/sim_and_scat).
Having cloned the content the last thing before running is to ensure that you have all of the necessary Python packages installed.
This can be achieved by opening the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS and Linux) and using the following command:

```
pip install sim-and-scat
```

This will download and install the necessary packages for the resource.
Now that the computer is ready to run the course it can all be found, in order, in the `run_local` directory.
