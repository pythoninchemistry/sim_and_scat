# Calculating Scattering

One of the main reasons that users of scattering techniques are interested in using molecular dynamics simulation is to **compare** between the experiment and the simulation. 
However, to do this there must be some parameter that is comparable.
A commonly used method is to compare the experimental scattering profile with that generated from the simulation trajectory.
There are many ways to derive such a profile, however we will focus only on the **Debye equation**.
